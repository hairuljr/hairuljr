### Hi, I'm Hairul Januar 👋  
Backend Engineer | Golang Specialist | Distributed Systems

I’m a backend engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable, high-performance systems.  
My primary focus is **Golang-based microservices**, API reliability, and system performance optimization.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- Design and develop **scalable backend services** using Golang
- Build and maintain **microservices architectures**
- Optimize system performance (latency, throughput, resource usage)
- Migrate **legacy monolith APIs → microservices**
- Implement **asynchronous processing & message brokers**
- Write clean, testable, production-ready code

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Golang (Echo, standard net/http)
- PHP (Legacy systems & migrations)

**Architecture & Infra**
- Microservices
- RESTful APIs
- Message Broker (RabbitMQ / Kafka conceptually)
- Asynchronous processing

**Database**
- MySQL / PostgreSQL
- Redis

**DevOps & Observability**
- Docker
- CI/CD
- Basic monitoring & logging (Prometheus / Grafana concept)
- Linux environment

---

## 📈 Highlights

- Improved API response time by **~40%** through async processing
- Successfully migrated legacy APIs into maintainable microservices
- Experience working with **remote & distributed teams**
- Strong focus on **code quality, testing, and reliability**

---

## 🌱 Currently Focusing On

- Advanced Go concurrency patterns
- System design for high-traffic services
- Improving observability & fault tolerance
- Deeper understanding of distributed systems
